    """Oaks amplicon data set

    This data set gives the abundance of 114 taxa (66 bacterial OTUs,
    48 fungal OTUs) in 116 samples (leaves).

    A 114 taxa by 116 samples offset matrix is also given, based on the total number of reads
    found in each sample, which depends on the technology used for either
    bacteria (16S) or fungi (ITS1).

    For each sample, 3 additional `exog` (tree, dist2ground, orientation) are known.

    The data is provided as a dictionary with the following keys:
        `endog`          a 114 x 116 np.array of integers (endog)
        `offsets`        a 114 x 116 np.array of integers (offsets)
        `tree`           a 114 x 1 vector of characters for the tree status
                         with respect to the pathogen (susceptible, intermediate, or resistant)
        `dist2ground`    a 114 x 1 vector encoding the distance of the sampled leaf
                         to the base of the ground
        `orientation`    a 114 x 1 vector encoding the orientation of the
                         branch (South-West SW or North-East NE)
