"""Implement all the model related to the PLN model, such as:
    - Variational model for PLN: fastPLN. It is very fast, but
        can't do dimension reduction. We can only infer Sigma that
        has size (p,p).
    - Variational model for PLN-PCA: fastPLNPCA
    - Importance Sampling based model for PLN-PCA. Relatively slow
        compared to fastPLN and fastPLNPCA. However, we don't do any approximation
        and infers the MLE.
