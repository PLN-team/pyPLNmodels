# PLNmodels: Poisson lognormal models

> The Poisson lognormal model and variants can be used for analysis of mutivariate count data.
> This package implements
> efficient algorithms extracting meaningful data from difficult to interpret
> and complex multivariate count data. It has been built to scale on large datasets even
> though it has memory limitations. Possible fields of applications include
> - Genomics (number of times a gene is expressed in a cell)
> - Ecology (species abundances)
> One main functionality is to normalize the count data to obtain more valuable
> data. It also analyse the significance of each variable and their correlation as well as the weight of
> covariates (if available).

##  Getting started
The getting started can be found [here](https://forgemia.inra.fr/bbatardiere/pyplnmodels/-/raw/dev/Getting_started.ipynb?inline=false). If you need just a quick view of the package, see the quickstart next.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

The package comes with an ecological data set to present the functionality
```
import pyPLNmodels
from pyPLNmodels.models import PlnPCAcollection, Pln
from pyPLNmodels.oaks import load_oaks
oaks = load_oaks()
```

### Unpenalized Poisson lognormal model (aka PLN)

```
pln = Pln.from_formula("counts ~ 1  + tree + dist2ground + orientation ", data = oaks, take_log_offsets = True)
pln.fit()
print(pln)
transformed_data = pln.transform()
```


### Rank Constrained Poisson lognormal for Poisson Principal Component Analysis (aka PLNPCA)

```
pca =  PlnPCAcollection.from_formula("counts ~ 1  + tree + dist2ground + orientation ", data = oaks, take_log_offsets = True, ranks = [3,4,5])
pca.fit()
print(pca)
transformed_data = pln.transform()
```
