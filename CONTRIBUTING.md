# What to work on

A public roadmap will be available soon.


## Fork/clone/pull

The typical workflow for contributing is:

1. Fork the `main` branch from the [GitLab repository](https://forgemia.inra.fr/bbatardiere/pyplnmodels).
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Run `pip install pre-commit` if pre-commit is not already installed.
4. Inside the repository, run '''pre-commit install'''.
5. Commit changes.
6. Push the changes to your fork.
7. Send a pull request from your fork back to the original `main` branch.
