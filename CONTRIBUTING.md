# What to work on

A public roadmap will be available soon.


## Fork/clone/pull

The typical workflow for contributing is:

1. Fork the `main` branch from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PLN-team/pyPLNmodels/).
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Run `pip install pre-commit` if pre-commit is not already installed.
4. Inside the repository, run `pre-commit install`.
5. Commit changes.
6. Push the changes to your fork.
7. Send a pull request from your fork back to the original `main` branch.
