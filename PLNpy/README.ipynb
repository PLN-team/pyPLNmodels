    "\n",
    "### Description of the package\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The packages implements 3 differents classes that fits a PLN-PCA model (described in the mathematical description above). Basically, it tries to find the correlation between features and the effect of covariables on these features. As main characteristic, this model takes into account count data. \n",
    "- The fastPLN class fits a PLN model (a special PLN-PCA model) using variational approximation. \n",
    "- The fastPLNPCA class fits a PLN-PCA  using variational approximation. \n",
    "- The IMPS_PLN fits a PLN-PCA model using Importance sampling. \n",
    "\n",
    "IMPS_PLN is always slower than fastPLN. fastPLNPCA is faster than fastPLN only for very large datasets. However, \n",
    "fastPLNPCA is convenient since it allows to get the Principal Components (PCs) directly, in contrary to fastPLN. To get the PCs using fastPLN, you first need to fit the model and do a PCA on the matrix $\\Sigma$  found. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these class are aggregated into the class PLNmodel, so that you don't need to deal with multiple classes. This class will automatically fit the data with one of those classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### How to fit the data? \n",
    "\n",
    "The package comes with an artificial dataset to present the functionality. You can load it doing the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Y = pd.read_csv('Y_test')\n",
    "O = pd.read_csv('O_test')\n",
    "cov = pd.read_csv('cov_test')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want $q$ Principal Composants, you only need to call: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "q = 5\n",
    "mypln = PLNmodel(q)\n",
    "mypln.fit(Y,O,cov)\n",
    "print(mypln)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you do not specify $q$, it will take the maximum possible value. You can look for a better approximation by setting ```fast = False ``` in the ```.fit()``` method, but it will take much more time:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "q = 5 \n",
    "mypln = PLNmodel(q)\n",
    "mypln.fit(Y,O,cov, fast = False)\n",

    "###### How to get the model parameters back ? \n",

    "##### Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main hyperparameters of the ```.fit()``` method of the ```fastPLN``` object:\n",
    "- ```N_iter_max```: The maximum number of iteration you are ready to do. If the algorithm has not converged, you can try to increase it. Default is 200. \n",
    "- ```tol```: tolerance of the model. The algorithm will stop if the ELBO (approximated likelihood of the model) has not increased of more than ```tol```. Try to decrease it if the algorithm has not converged. Default is ```1e-1```\n",
    "- ```good_init```: If set to ```True```, the algorithm will do an initialization that can take some time, especially for large datasets. You can set it to ```False``` if you want a much faster but random initialization. Default is ```True```. \n",
    "\n",
    "Those 3 parameters are important. However, they won't change the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm. If you launch the algorithm for a sufficient time (i.e. ```tol``` is small enough and ```N_iter_max``` is big enough), it will converge to the right parameters independently of the hyperparameters. Moreover, the default arguments are convenient for most datasets. \n",
    "If you want to see the progress of the algorithm in real time, you can set ```Verbose = True``` in the .```fit()``` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to be sure the algorithm has converged ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, if the ELBO reaches a plateau, the algorithm has converged. If it has not reached a plateau, then you can try to increase the number of iteration ```N_iter_max``` or lower the tolerance ```tol```. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you don't need to restart the algorithm from the beginning, you can start from where the algorithm has stopped by calling: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Fit the fastPLNPCA model\n",

    "```\n",
    "nbpcs = 5\n",
    "fastpca = fastPLNPCA(q=nbpcs)\n",

    "##### Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperparameters of the ```.fit()``` method of the ```IMPS_PLN``` are more complicated and technical. We suggest to take a look at the mathematical description of the package to gain intuition. Basically, the ```IMPS_PLN``` estimates the gradients of the log likelihood with importance sampling. Here are the main  hyperparameters and their impacts: \n",
    "- ```acc```: the accuracy of the approximation. The lower the better the gradient approximation, but the lower the algorithm. Default is 0.005 You can try to increasing it if you want to be faster. However reducing it won't gain much accuracy, and will significantly increase the convergence time. \n",
    "- ``` N_epoch_max```: The maximum number of iteration you are ready to do. If the tolerance has not converged, you can try to increase it. Default is 500. \n",
    "- ```lr```: Learning rate of the gradient ascent. You can try to reduce it or lower it, and see if the final likelihood has improved. Default is 0.1. \n",
    "- ```batch_size```: The batch size of the gradient descent. The larger the more accurate the gradients, but the slower the algorithm. if you have very large datasets, you can try to increase it. If you decrease it, then you hsould also decrease the learning rate. Default is 40. Should not exceed the number of samples you have in your dataset. \n",
    "- ```optimizer```: The optimizer you take for the gradient ascent. You can try ```torch.optim.RMSprop```, which is more robust to inappropriate learning rates. However lower the learning rate to 0.01 if using ```torch.optim.RMSprop```. Default is ```torch.optim.Adagrad```. \n",
    "- ```nb_plateau```: The algorithm will stop if the likelihood of the model has not increased during ```nb_plateau``` epochs. Default is 15. \n",
    "- ```nb_trigger```: Since the likelihood is approximated and random, we consider that the likelihood does not increase if during ```nb_trigger``` iterations it has not improved from the maximum likelihood computed. This parameter is here to deal with the randomness of the criterion.   Default is 5. \n",
    "- ```good_init```: If set to ```True```, the algorithm will do a precise initialization (that takes some time). You can remove this step by setting ```good_init = False ```. Default is True. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the progress of the algorithm in real time by setting ```verbose = True``` in the ```.fit()``` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to be sure the algorithm has converged ? \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no heuristics to know if the algorithm has converged. Indeed, even if you reach a plateau, it is possible that you can reach a much better plateau with other hyperparameters. However, this is in fact due to the choice of ```torch.optim.Adagrad``` as optimizer. If it has converged, it will be a very good solution. To have a (fast) convergence, you need to take the learning rate in the right interval. Fortunately, it is quite large: about ```[0.01, 0.3]``` for many cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have still not converged, you can try to change the optimizer to ```torch.optim.RMSprop```, but lower the learning to 0.02 or lower. You can also increase the batch_size and the number of iteration you do. If your dataset is not too big, as a last resort, you can try to set the learning rate to 0.1, taking as optimizer ```torch.optim.Rprop``` and set the ```batch_size``` to the number of samples you have in your dataset. \n",
