# Introduction

The Poisson lognormal (PLN) model can be extended to uncover clustering structures in count data. Two main approaches are available:

- **Supervised clustering**: when cluster labels are known for some samples (`PlnLDA`, [documentation](https://pln-team.github.io/pyPLNmodels/plnlda.html)).
- **Unsupervised clustering**: when cluster labels are unknown (`PlnMixture`, [documentation](https://pln-team.github.io/pyPLNmodels/plnmixture.html)).

We illustrate both using a single-cell RNA-seq dataset provided by the `load_scrna`
function of the package. Each row represents a cell and each column a gene. Cell types are
included as labels and used in the supervised setting.

# Data Loading and Structure

```{python}
from pyPLNmodels import load_scrna
rna = load_scrna(dim=20)
print("Data keys:", rna.keys())
```

## Count Matrix (`endog`)

```{python}
endog = rna["endog"]
print(endog.head())
```

## Cell Types (`labels`)

```{python}
cell_type = rna["labels"]
print("Cell types:", cell_type.unique())
print(cell_type.head())
print("Sample counts:", cell_type.value_counts())
```

# Supervised Clustering with `PlnLDA`

This method performs a Poisson lognormal discriminant analysis (PLN-LDA), similar to classical LDA but adapted to count data via a latent Gaussian layer.

## Model Formulation

Let $c_i$ denote the **known** cluster label for sample $i$:

$$
\begin{align}
Z_i| c_i = k &\sim \mathcal{N}(X_i^\top B + \mu_{k}, \Sigma), \\
Y_{ij} &\sim \mathcal{P}(\exp(o_{ij} + Z_{ij}))
\end{align}
$$

## Train-Test Split

We separate the data into training and test sets. The training set is used to fit the model, while the test set is used for evaluation.

```{python}
train_prop = 0.8
n_train = int(endog.shape[0] * train_prop)
endog_train, endog_test = endog[:n_train], endog[n_train:]
cell_type_train, cell_type_test = cell_type[:n_train], cell_type[n_train:]
```

## Fitting the PLN-LDA Model

```{python}
from pyPLNmodels import PlnLDA
lda = PlnLDA(endog_train, clusters=cell_type_train).fit()
print(lda)
```

You can also define the model using R-style formulas as follows:

```{python}
data_train = {"endog_train": endog_train, "clusters_train": cell_type_train}
_ = PlnLDA.from_formula("endog_train ~ 0 | clusters_train", data=data_train)
```

Use a pipe `|` to separate the exogenous variables from the clusters. See the
[dedicated tutorial](model_specifying.html) for more details on how to specify
a model.

## Predicting on Test Set

```{python}
pred_test = lda.predict_clusters(endog_test)
```

```{python}
from pyPLNmodels import plot_confusion_matrix
plot_confusion_matrix(pred_test, cell_type_test)
```

You can enhance performance by incorporating additional variables or increasing the number of samples in your dataset.

## Visualizing the Latent Space

The `.transform_new()` method transforms unseen endogenous data into the latent space via LDA.

```{python}
lda.viz_transformed(lda.transform_new(endog_test), colors=cell_type_test)
```

```{python}
lda.viz_transformed(lda.transform_new(endog_train), colors=cell_type_train)
```

### Optional: Exogenous Variables
You can include exogenous variables in the model; however, they will not be used
for making predictions. When predicting on new data, ensure that the corresponding
covariates for the samples are provided.

```{python}
import torch
dumb_lda = PlnLDA(endog_train, exog=torch.randn(endog_train.shape[0], 2), clusters=cell_type_train).fit()
_ = dumb_lda.predict_clusters(endog_test, exog=torch.randn(endog_test.shape[0], 2))
```

⚠️ Exogenous variables must be full rank, and an intercept will be added to
account for the cluster bias.. Avoid one-hot encodings without intercept removal.

# Unsupervised Clustering with `PlnMixture`

When no labels are known, `PlnMixture` fits a latent mixture model to identify
subpopulations in an **unsupervised** way.

## Model Formulation

$$
\begin{align}
c_i &\sim \mathcal{M}(1, \pi), \\
Z_i \mid c_i=k &\sim \mathcal{N}(X_i^\top B + \mu_k, \Sigma_k), \\
Y_{ij} &\sim \mathcal{P}(\exp(o_{ij} + Z_{ij}))
\end{align}
$$

Covariance matrices $\Sigma_k$ are assumed diagonal.

## Model Fitting

```{python}
from pyPLNmodels import PlnMixture
mixture = PlnMixture(endog, n_cluster=3).fit()
print(mixture)
```

### Optional: With Covariates

```{python}
_ = PlnMixture(endog, exog=torch.randn(endog.shape[0], 2), n_cluster=3)
```

⚠️ exogenous variables must be full rank, and an intercept will be added to
account for the cluster bias. Avoid one-hot encodings without intercept removal.

### Extracting Weights

```{python}
print(mixture.weights)
```

## Visualizing and Evaluating Clusters

One can access the clusters of the samples using the `.clusters` attribute:

```{python}
clusters = mixture.clusters
```

Some useful visualization and information about clusters are displayed using the `.show()` method:
```{python}
mixture.show()
```

One can visualize the latent variables using the `.viz()` method. By default,
the latent variables are colored by the inferred clusters, but other colors can
be specified using the `colors` argument.

```{python}
mixture.viz()
```

You can compare the inferred clusters with the actual cell types, although
retrieving the exact cell types is not expected since the method is unsupervised.


To visualize the clustering results, use the following:
```{python}
mixture.viz(colors=cell_type)
```
You can also assess the clustering performance with a confusion matrix:
```{python}
plot_confusion_matrix(clusters, cell_type)
```

## Predicting on New Data

You can predict unseen data using the `.predict_clusters()` method.

```{python}
new_clusters = mixture.predict_clusters(endog)
```

The number of clusters has been arbitrary set to $3$. A more data-driven
approach is given by the `PlnMixtureCollection` in the next section.

## Use `PlnMixtureCollection` for selecting the optimal number of clusters

To explore multiple cluster solutions, use `PlnMixtureCollection`:

```{python}
from pyPLNmodels import PlnMixtureCollection
collection = PlnMixtureCollection(endog, n_clusters=range(2, 8)).fit()
```

### Evaluate model quality

```{python}
collection.show(figsize=(8, 8))
```

This displays BIC, AIC, log-likelihood, and clustering metric (WCSS, silhouette) for each model.

Use the silhouette score (higher is better) or WCSS (lower is better) to
determine the optimal number of clusters. In this example, 2 clusters may be
appropriate.

⚠️  WCSS always decreases with the number of clusters, so that an [ELBOW
method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_method_(clustering)) must be used. Based on the graph and the WCSS metric, I would suggest 4 clusters.

The silhouette score is not sensitive to the number of clusters.

### Select the best model
One can directly access the best model using the `best_model` method, with the metric of choice:
```{python}
best_mixture = collection.best_model("silhouette") # Could be also BIC, AIC, or WCSS.
print(best_mixture)
```

You can access specific models within the collection by using the cluster number as a key:

```{python}
print(collection[3])
```
and loop through the collection:
```{python}
#|eval : false
for mixture in collection.values():
    print(mixture)
```
