# `pyPLNmodels` - Poisson lognormal models

The Poisson lognormal model and its variants are used for the
analysis of multivariate count data.
This package implements efficient algorithms to extract
meaningful insights from complex and difficult-to-interpret
multivariate count data. It is designed to scale on large
datasets, although it has memory limitations.


# In-depth `pyPLNmodels` tutorials
Unlike the [getting started
notebook](https://github.com/PLN-team/pyPLNmodels/blob/main/Getting_started.ipynb),
and the [quickstart](https://github.com/PLN-team/pyPLNmodels), this is an
in-depth tutorial, covering in detail different parts.

## Installation

First of all, you should run:

```{python}
#| eval: false
pip install pyPLNmodels
```

## Tutorials

- Check [how to specify a model](model_specifying.html).
- For a basic analysis of high-dimensional count data, see [this tutorial](basic_analysis.html).
- If your data is zero-inflated, you may consider the [zero-inflation tutorial](zero_inflation.html).
- If your data has temporality or one-dimensional spatiality, you should consider the [time-series tutorial for count data](autoreg.html).
- If you want to cluster your samples, be it in a supervised or unsupervised way, you should consider the [clustering tutorial for count data](clustering.html).
- You may do a network analysis, that is, see the link between variables, through the [network analysis tutorial for count data](network_analysis.html).
