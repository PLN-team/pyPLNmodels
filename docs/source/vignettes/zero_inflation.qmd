In this tutorial, we will analyse zero-inflated count data using the
`pyPLNmodels` package.
When the data is complex, simple models like Zero Inflation Poisson Regression
([ZIP](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.discrete.count_model.ZeroInflatedPoisson.html))
may lose valuable insights, such as correlation between variables.
This package includes two primary models for this purpose, effectively dealing
with zero-inflated data ($\approx$ percentage of 0's $>50\%$):

* `ZIPln` model ([documentation](https://pln-team.github.io/pyPLNmodels/zipln.html))
* `ZIPlnPCA` model ([documentation](https://pln-team.github.io/pyPLNmodels/ziplnpca.html))



The `ZIPlnPCA` model, similar to the `ZIPln` model, is specifically designed to
handle high-dimensional data, though it may slightly reduce parameter
estimation accuracy. These models are analogous to the
[`Pln`](https://pln-team.github.io/pyPLNmodels/pln.html) and
[`PlnPCA`](https://pln-team.github.io/pyPLNmodels/plnpca.html) models but are
capable of managing zero-inflation, albeit with an increase in computational time.

# Statistical background

Given a count matrix $Y$, each model assumes the following:

$$ Y_{ij}| Z_{ij}, W_{ij} \sim   (1 -W_{ij})\mathcal P(\exp(Z_{ij})), \quad Z_{i}\sim \mathcal N(o_i + X_i^{\top} B, \Sigma), \quad W_{ij} \sim \mathcal B(\sigma(X_i^{0^{\top}} B^0_j))$$
The latent variable $W$ is here to model the zero-inflation part of the data.
The input data is given by

* $Y_{ij}$ (denoted `endog` in the package) is the $j$-th count for the $i$-th observation
* $X_i$ (denoted `exog`) covariates for the $i$-th observation (if available)
* $X^0_i$ (denoted `exog_inflation`) covariates for the $i$-th observation (if available) for the inflation part
* $o_i$ (denoted `offsets`) offset for the $i$-th observation (if available)

and model parameters

* $B$ (denoted `coef` in the package) is a matrix of regression coefficients
* $B^0$ (denoted `coef_inflation` in the package) is a matrix of regression coefficients for the inflation part
* $\Sigma$ (denoted `covariance` in the package) is the covariance matrix of the latent variables $Z_i$




The `ZIPln` model assumes that $\Sigma$ has full rank, whereas the `ZIPlnPCA` model
assumes that $\Sigma$ has a low rank, which must be specified by the user. A
lower rank results in a greater compromise in parameter estimation.


### Role

The role of the `pyPLNmodels` package is to

* estimate the parameters $B$, $B^0$ and
$\Sigma$
* retrieving the latent variables $Z$ and $W$ using the input matrix $Y$ and,
  if available, the covariate matrix $X$ and its zero inflation counterpart
  $X^0$ (each defaults to a vector of 1's) and offsets $O$ (defaults to a
  matrix of 0's).

# Data importation

In this tutorial, we will analyze real count data from the microcosm
dataset available through the NCBI BioProject
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA875059). This
dataset contains microbiota members from body sites of dairy cows
throughout lactation. The data includes counts (`endog`), site
information (`site` and `site_1hot`), time information (`time` and
`time_1hot`), and lineage information (`lineage` and
`lineage_1hot`). The `1_hot` variables represent the one-hot encoded versions
of the respective categorical variables.
 For visualization purposes, we will consider only
20 variables (i.e. dimensions):

```{python}
from pyPLNmodels import load_microcosm
micro = load_microcosm(dim = 20)
print('Data: ', micro.keys())
```

The dataset is hihgly zero-inflated, with a percentage of zeros of $96\%$:
```{python}
endog = micro["endog"]
print("Percentage of zeros: ", (endog == 0).sum().sum()/ endog.size * 100, "%")
```

On a log scale, here is the distribution of the counts:
```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.hist(endog.values.ravel(), bins=100)
plt.yscale('log')
plt.show()
```
### Covariates
```{python}
site = micro["site"]
print('Possible sites: ', site.unique())
time = micro["time"]
print('Possible times: ', time.unique())
lineage = micro["lineage"]
print('Possible lineages: ', lineage.unique())
```

# Model fitting without considering zero-inflation

We will first fit a `Pln` model without zero-inflation. Check about the `Pln` model here ??
We only consider the `site` covariates for the moment.

```{python}
from pyPLNmodels import Pln
pln = Pln.from_formula('endog ~ 1 + site', data = micro).fit()
pln.viz(colors = micro["site"])
```

```{python}
print(pln)
```

# Model fitting considering zero-inflation

```{python}
from pyPLNmodels import ZIPln
zipln = ZIPln.from_formula('endog ~ 1 + site', data = micro).fit()
zipln.viz(colors = micro["site"])
```

Zero-inflation considerably improves the model and reduces the noise of the
latent variables.

```{python}
print(zipln)
```
The log likelihood is considerably improved.


# Zero-inflation parameters

A regression parameter is available for the zero-inflation part. It can be visualized, as well as other parameters and insights through the `.show` method:

```{python}
zipln.show()
```
An inferred probability to be zero-inflated for each entry of `endog` can also be accessed. Naturally, the probability is null
when the count is non zero.

```{python}
zipln.show_prob()
```

# Considering different covariates between zero-inflation and count part

It is possible to consider different covariates for the zero-inflation part and
the count part. When considering formula parsing, the zero-inflation part
is separated by a `|` symbol. For example, if we want to consider the `site`
covariate for the count part and the `time` covariate for the zero-inflation, we get:

```{python}
zitime_pln = ZIPln.from_formula('endog ~ 1 + site | time', data = micro).fit()
zitime_pln.show()
```

```{python}
zitime_pln.viz(colors = micro["time"])
```


# Handling high-dimensional data

The `ZIPlnPCA` is the zero-inflated version of the `PlnPCA` model. It is
designed to handle high-dimensional data. A compromise is made on the accuracy
of the covariance matrix.
```{python}
from pyPLNmodels import ZIPlnPCA
high_d_micro = load_microcosm(dim = 500)
zipca = ZIPlnPCA.from_formula('endog ~ 1 + site', data=high_d_micro, rank=5).fit()
```

The number of ranks is an hyperparameter that can be user-defined. A more
data-driven approach to selecting the rank can be achieved using the
`ZIPlnPCACollection` class. This class fit multiple models with different ranks:


```{python}
from pyPLNmodels import ZIPlnPCACollection
zipcas = ZIPlnPCACollection.from_formula('endog ~ 1 + site', data=high_d_micro, ranks=[3,5, 10, 15]).fit()
```

The best model can be accessed through the `.best_model()` method. The metric used is the criterion, that can be either `AIC`, `BIC` or `ICL`:



```{python}
best_zipca = zipcas.best_model(criterion = "BIC")
print(best_zipca)
```


However, it might choose  a model with the largest rank, which is not desired.
One can visualize the different models and their criteria using the `.show()` method:


```{python}
zipcas.show()
```

All individuals models can be accessed as a [python
collection](https://docs.python.org/fr/3.13/library/collections.html):

```{python}
zipca_5 = zipcas[5]
print(zipca_5)
```

And one can iterate throughout the collection:
```{python}
for zipca in zipcas.values():
    print(zipca)
```

## More information

Any valuable method or attribute can be viewed by printing the model.
Some are specific to the `ZIPln` model, such as the `coef_inflation` and `latent_prob`.
