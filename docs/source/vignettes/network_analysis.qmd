# Introduction

The `PlnNetwork` model in the pyPLNmodels package is designed for sparse network
inference from multivariate count data, using a
penalized precision matrix. It allows for network structure learning between
variables, such as genes in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets.

This tutorial demonstrates how to:

- Initialize a `PlnNetwork` ([documentation](https://pln-team.github.io/pyPLNmodels/plnnetwork.html)) model from count data or using a formula interface

- Fit the model with regularization on the precision matrix

- Visualize inferred network structures and latent variables

- Gives tools for selecting the optimal penalty

## Statistical background

Compared to the `Pln` model, a constraint is imposed on the precision matrix
$\Sigma^{-1}$ of the latent space to enforce sparsity (@network):

$$
\begin{align}
Z_i &\sim \mathcal{N}(X_i^{\top} B, \Sigma), \quad \|\Sigma^{-1}\|_1 \leq C \\
Y_{ij} \mid Z_{ij} &\sim \mathcal{P}(\exp(o_{ij} + Z_{ij})),
\end{align}
$$
where $C$ is a penalty parameter. See @network for more details.

## Data importation

For visualization purposes, we use only 20 variables (i.e. genes).

```{python}
from pyPLNmodels import load_scrna
data = load_scrna(dim = 20)
endog = data["endog"]
```

# Model initialization and fitting

A penalty needs to be specified for the model. The greater the penalty, the
sparser the precision matrix will be and the lower the number of linked
variables. We use a value of $200$ for now.

```{python}
from pyPLNmodels import PlnNetwork
net = PlnNetwork(endog, penalty=200).fit()
```

# Network visualization

```{python}
net.viz_network()
```

The network can be accessed as a dictionnary through the `network` attribute:


```{python}
network = net.network
print(network)
print("Genes associated with APOE: ", network["APOE"])
```

# Use `PlnNetworkCollection` for selecting the optimal penalty

The penalty is an hyperparameter that needs to be tuned. To explore multiple
penalty solutions, use `PlnNetworkCollection`:

```{python}
from pyPLNmodels import PlnNetworkCollection
collection = PlnNetworkCollection(endog, penalties=[0.1,10,1000]).fit()
```


## Evaluate model quality

```{python}
collection.show(figsize=(8, 8))
```

This displays the BIC, AIC and log-likelihood criteria for each model,
helping to identify the most suitable one. Additionally, the number of links
(i.e., non-zero elements in the precision matrix) is provided. You may consider
using the ELBOW method to select the optimal model based on the number of links.

## Selecting the best model


The best model can be chosen according to the BIC or AIC:

```{python}
best_net = collection.best_model("BIC") # Could be also AIC.
print(best_net)
```
One can also access each individual model in the collection, using the penalty as a key:

```{python}
print(collection[10])
```
and loop through the collection:

```{python}
#|eval : false
for net in collection.values():
    print(net)
```
