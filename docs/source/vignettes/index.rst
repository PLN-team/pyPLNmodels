Beyond the basics of `pyPLNmodels`
==================================


Unlike the `getting started notbeook <https://github.com/PLN-team/pyPLNmodels/blob/main/Getting_started.ipynb>`_,
and the `quickstart <https://github.com/PLN-team/pyPLNmodels>`_, this is an
in-depth tutorial, covering different parts.

First of all, you should run

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pyPLNmodels

Next, you can check `how to specify a model <model_specifying.html>`_. For a
basic analysis of high-dimensional count data,  see `this
<basic_analysis.html>`_.

If your data is zero-inflated, you may consider the  `zero-inflation tutorial
<zero_inflation.html>`_


Your data have temporality or one dimensional spatiality ? You should consider the  `temporality tutorial for count data
<autoreg.html>`_.

If you want to cluster your variables, be it in a supervised or unsupervised way, you should consider the `clustering tutorial for count data
<clustering.html>`_.

You may do a network analysis, that is see the link between variables, through the `network analysis tutorial for count data
<network_analysis.html>`_
