With increasing availability of powerful computing facilities an obvious candidate for consideration is now the multivariate log normal mixture of independent Poisson distributions, the multivariate Poisson-log normal distribution. The properties of this discrete multivariate distribution are studied and its uses in a variety of applications to multivariate count data are illustrated.}",
